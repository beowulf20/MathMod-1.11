**MathMod**
=======

Why?
----

*I've created this mod because I worked as a math teacher in a public school in Brazil in 2017 and I felt the need to use Minecraft simply because it is what kids liked at the time.* <br />**The results so far:** both parents and children are loving it.


----------


What the does it do?
--------------------

So far I've created 4 different blocks. Each one of them, when right-clicked, opens a GUI that display 5 differents types of minigames (Basic Operations, Odd and Even, Roman Numerals, Successor and Predecessor)<br />
When the kid writtes the right answer, the mod gives them a "Math Coin", which can be used to bay any block/item registered in the game through a "Shop Block".
